# Example Custom Connectors

You can find the example custom connectors on [GitHub](https://github.com/Microsoft/PowerPlatformConnectors/tree/master/custom-connectors). These examples demonstrate certain key features of connectors. The following table gives a brief description of some of the examples, with links to each.

| Connector Name | Description |
| --- | ---|
| [Azure Key Vault](https://github.com/Microsoft/PowerPlatformConnectors/tree/master/custom-connectors/AzureKeyVault) |  This sample allows you to manage your keys, secrets, and certificates in Azure Key Vault by providing operations to get or create these items. |
| [Facebook](https://github.com/Microsoft/PowerPlatformConnectors/tree/master/custom-connectors/Facebook) | This sample shows how to use the Facebook connector to read and post to Facebook feeds and pages. |
| [Office365Groups](https://github.com/Microsoft/PowerPlatformConnectors/tree/master/custom-connectors/Office365Groups) |  This sample contains a connector that uses the Microsoft Graph API to do various Office 365 Groups operations such as creating a group, listing groups, adding members to a group, and so on. |

## Use the examples

To use one of these connector examples in your Power Automate/Power App, you'll need to create a custom connector using the sample. The [Microsoft Power Platform Connectors CLI](https://github.com/Microsoft/PowerPlatformConnectors/tree/master/tools/paconn-cli) helps you create a custom connector directly from the command line. Go to [Create a new custom connector](https://github.com/Microsoft/PowerPlatformConnectors/tree/master/tools/paconn-cli#create-a-new-custom-connector) to learn how you can create a custom connector from one of these examples.
